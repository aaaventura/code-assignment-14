This project sets up a development environment for a React app using Docker.

## Prerequisite

- git is required to clone the repository from github: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
- Docker is required to build and run the application: https://docs.docker.com/engine/

## How to Run the App

1. You can clone the Repository through git with:
   `bash git clone https://github.com/aaaventura/code-assignment-14`

2. Change to the directory with:
   `cd code-assignment-14`

3. Build the docker application into a container image:
   `docker build -t ventura_ahleeryan-joe_assignment14 .`

4. Run the application on localhost:5575:
   `docker run -p 5575:5575 ventura_ahleeryan-joe_assignment14`

5. To verify your build, open your browser and visit:
   `http://localhost:5575`

   If you are successful in your build, you will see the portfolio site.

## troubleshooting

- Double check the version of Node.js with: `node -v`
  The application uses the Node.js version 20.19.2.

  To switch versions, use: `nvm use 20`

- If Docker says the port is in use, use `bash docker ps` to display all currently running containers.
  Then use `docker stop <container_using_5575>`

          Note: root Access may be required to terminate other containers.

- A reoccuring error is Docker not installing the correct npm version. To fix this error, manual install will be required.
  Use `npm install` and then try step 4 again.
