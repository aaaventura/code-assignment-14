This project sets up a development environment for a React app using Docker.

## Prerequisite

- git is required to clone the repository from github: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git
- Docker is required to build and run the application: https://docs.docker.com/engine/

## How to Run the App

1. You can clone the Repository through git with:
   `bash git clone https://github.com/aaaventura/code-assignment-13`

2. Change to the directory with:
   `cd code-assignment-13`

3. Build the docker application into a container image:
   `docker build -t ventura_ahleeryan-joe_assignment13 .`

4. Run the application on localhost:8083:
   `docker run -p 8018:8018 ventura_ahleeryan-joe_assignment13`

5. To verify your build, open your browser and visit:
   `http://localhost:8018`

   If you are successful in your build, you will see the spinning React App logo and the header "Edit src/App.tsx and save to reload."

6. To verify your storybook, run it using `npm run storybook`, open your browser and visit:
   `http://localhost:6006`

   This should present the storybook UI with all the components according to the assignment's requirements.

## troubleshooting

- Double check the version of Node.js with: `node -v`
  The application uses the Node.js version 20.19.2.

  To switch versions, use: `nvm use 20`

- If Docker says the port is in use, use `bash docker ps` to display all currently running containers.
  Then use `docker stop <container_using_8083>`

          Note: root Access may be required to terminate other containers.

- A reoccuring error is Docker not installing the correct npm version. To fix this error, manual install will be required.
  Use `npm install` and then try step 4 again.

- A reoccuring error is Docker not installing storybook. To fix this error, manual install will be required.
  Use `npm create storybook@latest`, follow the recommended installation, and then try step 6 again.

- A reoccuring error is Docker not installing husky. To fix this error, manual install will be required.
  Use `npm install husky@4.3.0`

- A reoccuring error is Docker not installing prettier. To fix this error, manual install will be required.
  Use `npm install prettier`
